"Data valuation is a process that quantifies how much individual data instances influence the optimization and generalization of a model. It reveals characteristics and importance of individual instances, which may provide useful information in diagnosing and improving deep learning. For example, we can reduce the train dataset by removing data whose value is low, without loss of performance.",True,Can you define 'data valuation' and explain why it's essential in deep learning?
"The limitations or drawbacks of existing data valuation techniques that prompted the development of a training-free method are that most of them require actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational cost.",True,What is the limitations or drawbacks of existing data valuation techniques that prompted you to develop a training-free method?
"The complexity-gap score is a data valuation score that measures the influence of individual instances in neural network generalization. Complexity-gap score of a target data is how much the dataset complexity is reduced when the target data is removed from the whole dataset. The dataset complexity, which is induced from theoretical analysis of 2-layer overparameterized neural network, is calculated with gram matrix of input data and label vector.
It can identify irregular or mislabeled data instances and can be used to analyze datasets and diagnose training dynamics.",True,"Could you kindly elaborate on what the complexity-gap score is, and how does it measure data irregularities without any need for modeling?"
"Computational cost of complexity-gap score depends on size of gram matrix. Precisely, the cost is O(n^3) when n is size of the gram matrix. In practice, if n<20000, the computational cost is cheaper than other methodologies. However, if n>20000, computational cost of complexity gap score is not cheap.",True,"In practice, how does using this comlpexity-gap score compare to dealing with previously generalized deep learning models? Does it reduce the computational cost significantly?"
Complexity-gap score of NLP dataset might be a promising future work.,True,What potential future applications do you see for the complexity-gap measurement methodology? Do you have plans for further development or any possible limitations that need to be addressed?
The complexity-gap score helps identify 'irregular or mislabeled' data instances by quantifying the irregularity of the instances and measuring how much each data instance contributes in the total movement of the network parameters during training. The complexity-gap score is a data-centric score that quantifies the influence of individual instances in generalization of two-layer overparameterized neural networks.,True,"How does the complexity-gap score help identify 'irregular or mislabeled' data instances, following the absence of model training step? Can you give some practical applications on this process?"
"Complexity-gap score has uniqueness that it does not require actual training.
Moreover, complexity-gap score proposes possibility of dividing irregular data and mislabeled data by observing sign of partial-complexity-gap score, while many existing methods of data valuation suffer from diving irregular data and mislabeled data.
",True,Could you explain further about how the 'Complexity-Gap Score' proposes its unique implications for finding 'irregular or mislabeled' data instances?
"The feature-complexity-gap score seems to be a very effective score, and can be applied in the real-world scenario.
Feature-complexity-gap score requires training of only few epochs, however, it valuate effectively even in complex dataset.",True,"In terms of applicability, where do you see possible extensions of the complexity-gap score's significance within real-world scenario beyond datasets analyses and diagnosing training dynamics, specifically designed around ML algorithms."
