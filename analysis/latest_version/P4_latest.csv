The main contribution of AltUB is that it introduces alternating training to update the base distribution of normalizing flow for anomaly detection. This approach effectively improves the stability of performance of normalizing flow and enhances the expressive power of the normalizing flow for anomaly detection.,True,What is the main contribution of AltUB?
"Normalizing flow is a major approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. It pursues the invertible transformation of a complex distribution such as images into an easy distribution such as N(0, I). The original usages of normalizing flow are density estimation and generating data efficiently using invertible mappings. Some recent approaches have begun to utilize normalizing flow to tackle unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.",True,Could you provide some background on normalizing flow and its significance in unsupervised anomaly detection?
The authors of the study propose using alternating training instead of the classical approach in anomaly detection tasks because the classical approach often fails to convert images into the base distribution. They suggest that alternating training improves the stability by addressing the limited expressive power of normalizing flow with a fixed base distribution. ,True,"Why did they suggest alternating training rather than the classical approach: fixing the base distribution as N(0, I)?"
"Generally, the base distribution is trained with the same learning rate with normalizing flow. But only the base distribution is trained with the larger learning rate every few epochs. ",True,What does alternating training mean specifically?
"The authors insisted the learning rate for normalizing flow models was not large enough to train base distribution. Hence, they introduced ""alternating training"" rather than the general one because they found that alternating updates in the Alternating Training method to Update Base distribution (AltUB) allowed the model to adapt to the changed base distribution effectively, but gradually. ",True,"Why did they introduce""alternating training"" rather than the general one?"
The paper provided that the average of AUROC during the training was significantly improved after the introduction of AltUB and the model achieved the new state-of-the-art performance of the anomaly segmentation task on the MVTec AD dataset with 98.8.,True,How much AltUB improved the performance of anomaly detection models?
