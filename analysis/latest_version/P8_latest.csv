"Existing traffic prediction models often overlook the underlying nature of traffic due to their focus on deep learning architectures and the inaccurate representation of the actual road network used by vehicles in most traffic datasets. Also, recently there is trend to automatically train the sensor adjacency matrix by deep learning algorithm, however, they may generate inaccurate connection without understanding their geographical location or road network.",True,Could you discuss the existing shortcomings in traditional traffic prediction models that led to your research?
"The integration of human activity analysis with deep learning algorithms in traffic prediction aims to address the shortcomings of current models by considering the nature of traffic and providing insights into urban traffic patterns. With the use of human activity frequency data, this approach improves the ability to infer a causal relationship between activities and traffic patterns while maintaining high performance and computational efficiency.",True,What was the impetus for marrying human activity analysis with traditional deep learning algorithms in traffic prediction?
"It is traffic sensor data installed in California, you can access data through PeMS(https://pems.dot.ca.gov/) system. The authors of DCRNN, STGCN published traffic datasets gathered from this system, and we leverage their METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, PEMSD7 dataset.",True,What kind of sensor data is being used in your model?
"We leveraged the traffic speed records for the experiment from METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and PEMSD7 datasets, and to compare with baseline models. Also, these datasets contains original sensor adjacency matrix provided by the authors which we call legacy graph in our paper. Plus, the traffic sensors in their dataset contains the PeMS ID that is identifiable its exact location installed in the PeMS system. Additionally, Open Street Map (OSM) data is leveraged to accurately match the sensor locations to the corresponding roads. In conclusion, we mainly focus on exact sensor location on the freeway, and connectivity or accessibility by vehicles to construct well data-engineered sensor adjacency graph.",True,"Can you discuss how the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and PEMSD7 datasets are utilized in developing your prediction model?"
"We construct the proximity graph between traffic sensors by generating probable travel path by vehicles in the city.

Plus, we apply one-hot sensor embedding that captures sensor heterogenity.

Finally, we apply activity-embedding which is urban human activity frequency on each timestamp estimated from National Household Travel Survey.

Each module (graph, sensor embedding, activity embedding) improved the conventional traffic prediction methods such as Graph Convolutional Neural Network or Graph Convolutional Transformer, by applying each component on early input of the model.",True,"Can you describe how significant your model's enhancements, despite making only minimal modification, compare to conventional traffic predicting techniques?"
"Yes. The proposed models, UAGCRN and UAGCTransformer, achieved state-of-the-art performance in traffic forecasting without adding excessive computational overhead. These models consistently outperformed other baselines and showed that incorporating graph convolutions improves accuracy. What we mean by minimal modifications is that conventional spatio-temporal models for traffic prediction transforms the input into embedding of spatial and temporal dimension. For example, you want to embed one traffic real value from sensor (among N sensors) and timestamp (among P historical time stamps) into D-dimensional embedding, it converts (1) into (N, P, D) dimension. What we have done is adding sensor embedding (in spatial dimension, (N, 1, D)) and activity embedding (in temporal dimension (1, P, D)), in general all models performance has enhanced. These models includes GCRN, GCTransformer, LSTM, and Transformer.  ",True,"Despite making minimal modifications to conventional graph convolutional networks, how were you able to achieve enhanced performance?"
"We leverage Dual-walk Graph Convolutional Neural Network, which is originally proposed in DCRNN (Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network). However, while the original DCRNN requires diffusion steps (e.g. 3 steps), while we only leverage 1 step DCRNN, also showing performance improvement. The key point is we did not change the original modules, but with more data-processing effort, we achieved state-of-the-art performance.",True,How does using graph convolution deep learning algorithms enhance your traffic prediction methods?
"The authors chose to utilize data from the National Household Travel Survey to enhance the inference capability of a causal relationship between activity and traffic patterns. This data helps capture the correlation between human activity and traffic patterns, contributing to the method's effectiveness in predicting traffic patterns.",True,Why did you choose to utilize data from the National Household Travel Survey and how is this contributing to the method's effectiveness?
"In the study, human activity frequency data from the National Household Travel Survey is used to enhance the inference capability of a causal relationship between activity and traffic patterns. This data is estimated at the target prediction timestamp and is incorporated into the proposed traffic prediction method based on graph convolution deep learning algorithms. We also believe it has implication for the future research as if we find causal relationship between urban human activity and traffic pattern more accurately, it will enable model to be applied to long-term prediction or solid performance on sudden activity changes. Also, if we understand the cause of traffic congestion from human activity, it will help urban designers to alleviate such urban problems.",True,Can you explain the role of human activity frequency data from National Household Travel Survey in your study?
"The National Household Travel Survey data enhanced the inference capability of a causal relationship between activity and traffic patterns, providing insights into the traffic patterns in urban activities. However, it still has limitation such as it does not show human activity in localized city. Currently, traditional way to leverage timestamp embedding (embedding of weekday and time-of-a-day) outperforms, however, we believe it improves the inference ability and more fits the continuous nature rather than discrete timestamp embedding approach. We discuss in the results section.",True,How essential was the data received from National Household Travel Survey in identifying the relationship between human activities and traffic patterns?
"Potential future research directions opened by introducing human activities into traffic pattern analysis include accurately inputting human activity frequency, such as localized activity estimation considering demographics and urban function. We would like to connect AI-driven traffic prediction with transportation research based simulative environment. One of our future research is to build the most realistic traffic simulator that reflects the real-world traffic sensor values, and this research is the very first step for our vision.",True,What are potential future research directions opened by introducing human activities into traffic pattern analysis?

This method attains remarkable performance improvements while keeping computational demands modest. The computational overhead remains minimal, being 3x to 5x faster than conventional methods. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that even temporal-only models can be viable for traffic prediction, yielding respectable performance results.",True,What would AI developers working on traffic prediction  will  be interested about your paper?
"It can also be used to optimize traffic flow and road network design, thereby reducing congestion and improving the overall quality of life in urban areas.",True,"Beyond improving safety and convenience, what are potential practical applications of the updated model in urban planning or transportation areas?"
